        <h1>Secret of the Wind</h1>
        <h2>A mysterious night where nature whispers fogotten stories<sup>*</sup></h2>
        <p>
            The wind whispered through the trees as if it were telling ancient secrets.
            The leaves danced aimlessly, lulled by an invisible melody.
            Somewhere in the distance, a cat walked silently across the rooftops, observing the world with curious eyes.
            The stars, shyly, began to appear in the dark blue sky, announcing a night full of mysteries.
            Meanwhile, a cup of tea grew cold, forgotten on the window, waiting for someone who might never return.

            - <i>"Sometimes the answers we seek are hidden in the silence of the wind and the discreet brightness of the stars"</i>.

        <h2>
            <mark>Stories that only the moon and stars can hear</mark>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Up above, the moon watches silently, guardian of nocturnal confessions.
            The stars blink curiously, like little witnesses to every unspoken thought, every dream held in the heart.
            Amidst the soft shadows, secrets float in the air, pass through open windows and rest on the branches of the trees. 
            Those who pass unnoticed by the night cannot imagine how many stories it collects, how many smiles, tears and promises dissolve in the silence.
            And so, the moon and the stars continue to listen, eternal confidants os a world that only reveals itself when everyone is asleep.

            whispers Only the Night Understands

        <p>
            At midnight, when the world is asleep, the <strong>night</strong> begins to <strong>breathe</strong>.
            The <strong><u>moonlight</u></strong> spills like silver ink across empty streets, and the stars become tiny <strong>lanterns</strong> guilding lost thoughts home.
            Every soft breeze carries a <strong><u>hidden story</u></strong>, every shadow hides a <strong><i>forgotten dream</i></strong>. 
            Only the night can hear these <strong>whispers</strong>, soft as a secret, echoing in the darkness. 
            In those quiet hours, the universe feels <strong>closer</strong>, and hearts beat with a quiet <strong>longing</strong> for something they can't quite name.
