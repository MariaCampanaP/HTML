00:04.000 --> 00:10.000
Take me out tonight

00:10.000 --> 00:18.000
Where there's music and there's people and they're young and alive

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Driving in your car

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
I never, never want to go home

00:24.000 --> 00:33.000
Because I haven't got one anymore

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
Take me out tonight

00:38.000 --> 00:46.000
Because I want to see people and I want to see life

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Driving in your car

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Oh, please don't drop me home

00:52.000 --> 01:03.000
Because it's not my home, it's their home and I want them all

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
And if a double-decker bus

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
Crashes into us

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
And if a ten-ton truck

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
Kills the both of us

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
To die by your side

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
Well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
Take me out tonight

01:38.000 --> 01:45.000
Take me anywhere, don't care, don't care, don't care

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
And in the darkened and the past

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
I thought, oh God, my chance has come at last

01:52.000 --> 02:01.000
But then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
Take me out tonight

02:05.000 --> 02:14.000
Oh, take me anywhere, don't care, don't care, don't care

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Driving in your car

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
I never, never want to go home

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
Because I haven't got one for long

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
Oh, I haven't got one

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
And if a double-decker bus

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Crashes into us

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
And if a ten-ton truck

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
Kills the both of us

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
To die by your side

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
Well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine

02:59.000 --> 03:27.000
Oh, there is a light and it never goes out
